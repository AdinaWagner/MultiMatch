An example compuation
**********************
The following section shows a multimatch use case to compute the scanpath

during simultaneous fMRI acquisition.

Data and sample
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Data stems from the 2016 release of the studyforrest_ dataset. N = 15 subjects
watched the audiovisual movie "Forrest Gump". The dataset contains participants

Raw eye gaze data were classified into different categories of eye movements
with the REMoDNaV_ algorithm. For information regarding the algorithm and its
use, please see its corresponding publication_.
