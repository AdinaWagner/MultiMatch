***************


**multimatch_gaze** is a python-based reimplementation of the MultiMatch algorithm
(Jarodzka, Holmqvist & Nystr√∂m, 2010).
The original Matlab toolbox was kindly provided via email by Dr. Richard Dewhurst
and the method was ported into Python with the intent of providing an open source
alternative to the matlab toolbox.


The module provides the possibility to compute the similarity of two scanpaths
with a terminal command or within a python instance (see section API_).

Installation
************

It is recommended to use a dedicated virtualenv_.

.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io

.. code::

   # create and enter a new virtual environment (optional)
   virtualenv --python=python3 ~/env/multimatch
   . ~/env/multimatch/bin/activate


Via pip install
---------------


multimatch can be installed via pip_ (**P**\ip **I**\nstalls **P**\ython). To
automatically install multimatch with all dependencies type::

   pip install multimatch

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io


Via Github
----------

The source code for multimatch can be found on Github_.

A short tutorial...
-------------------

... session to get a first hang on how to use multimatch can be
conducted by cloning the Github repository and executing the
examples provided in the API_
section. The data used in these examples corresponds to the
data found in the repository.
