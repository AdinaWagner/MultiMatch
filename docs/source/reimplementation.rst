***************


**multimatch-gaze** is a python-based reimplementation of the MultiMatch algorithm
(Jarodzka, Holmqvist & Nystr√∂m, 2010).
The original Matlab toolbox was kindly provided via email by Dr. Richard Dewhurst
and the method was ported into Python with the intent of providing an open source
alternative to the matlab toolbox.


The module provides the possibility to compute the similarity of two scanpaths
with a terminal command or within a python instance (see section API_).
